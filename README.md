# base-ui

BaseUI is a UI builder for Luau. It's designed to be type-safe, terse in its
syntax, and highly extensible by allowing people to tap into the core library
to create their own GUI primitives or widgets. It also exposes APIs such as
init hooks which allow you to run events/hooks every time a GUI primitive is
initialized.
